SpeedyShop
==========

SpeedyShop is a Javascript-powered website for our CS3450 School Project in which customers can select items,
add them to a cart, and psuedo-purchase them. Employees manage employees,
while admins can view sales and manage the item list.

The project is live on http://speedyshop.herokuapp.com, which is manually updated. Run the code here for the latest version.
